## my-api

This API (Application Programming Interface) project uses Node.js & Express to accept, return, and (in the future) store data.

This project currently allows for data to be stored locally until the server is restarted. 

In the future this project will connect to a PostgreSQL database using Docker Compose. This project currently is built to work with my Stack project.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Use Postman or Bash to run requests to the server.
